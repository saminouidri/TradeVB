## What is TradeVB?
A simple stock market simulator with a secure login. You start with a 100$, and through some investments can reach thousands. The stock's prices are updated regularly (randomly I might add) as well as exchange rate for the US dollar. 

### Secure Login
On login, TradeVB listens for a special code transmitted over serial by a third-party device (in our case, an arduino with a fingerprint reader), in order to secure your non-existent funds. This is to demonstrate hardware security as a concept (like in the case of bitcoin wallets) for future projects.
